        <h4>
            This delicious sauce goes great with middle-eastern dishes like falafel. Tahini sauce is rich, creamy,
            perfectly smooth, nutty and tangy. Its subtle garlic flavor enhances the toasted sesame flavor, rather than
            overwhelms or detracts.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 medium-to-large cloves garlic, pressed or minced</li>
            <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>½ cup tahini</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
            <li>Pinch of ground cumin</li>
            <li>6 Tbsp ice water, more as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, combine the garlic and lemon juice. Let the mixture rest for 10 minutes, to give the
                garlic time to infuse the lemon juice with flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into another medium bowl. Press the garlic solids with a
                spatula to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the garlic.
            </li>
            <li>Add the tahini, salt and cumin to the bowl. Whisk until the mixture is thoroughly blended.</li>
            <li>
                Add water 2 tablespoons at a time, whisking after each addition until smooth. (It may seize up, don’t
                worry.) After about 6 tablespoons, you will have a perfectly creamy and smooth, light-colored tahini
                sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                If desired, thin with additional water for a more drizzly sauce. Adjust if necessary—if you’d like more
                tang, add more lemon, or for more overall flavor, add another pinch of salt. Your tahini sauce is ready
                to serve!
            </li>
        </ol>
