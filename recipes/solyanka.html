        <h4>
            Solyanka is a traditional Russian and Eastern European soup known for its hearty, rich, and tangy flavor. It
            is typically made with a mix of meats (like sausages, ham, beef, or smoked pork), or sometimes fish or
            mushrooms, making it very versatile. This version is vegan and of course vegetable-based.
